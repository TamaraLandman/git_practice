        <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
        <br>
        <p id="coding-journey">
            Since middle school I had been interested in coding, but I 
            never had the opportunity to learn more about it since my school
            didn't offer any CS classes. In the summer going into high school,
            I signed up for a Girls Who Code program and I was hooked. After that, I 
            continued learning CS through GWC and Kode With Klossy, which I found the
            next year. I did 3 Kode With Klossy camps and learnt so much about
            app development, data science, and AI. Now, I'm a CS student and I'm 
            so excited to finally take real computer science classes that I never 
            had the chance to take in high school
